MelodiCode uses artificial intelligence to take on the complex task of musical composition. It analyzes several songs and composes a song of similar style/genre using maximum likelihood estimation and neural networks to generate note patterns and link them with chord progressions, tempo, dynamics, etc.

To use: 
1. Download the zip file, navigate to the directory where it is stored and compile/run the composer.java class
2. The program will prompt you to enter the number of notes you would like to generate
3. The song that is generated will be played!
